Receiving Events from PLAY
==========================
To receive events from PLAY this is needed:

1. listen on a HTTP endpoint for events
2. subscribe that endpoint address for one or more streams of PLAY events
3. unwrap event from its JSON REST message
4. parse the RDF

... details to be added.

... a generic approach for mobile phones is still needed (they don't expose an HTTP endpoint)
